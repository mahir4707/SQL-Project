📊 Sales Orders Analysis Using SQL (PostgreSQL)
This project is all about analyzing a company's order data using SQL in PostgreSQL. The goal was to turn raw sales data into meaningful business insights that can help in decision-making.

🔍 What I Did:
Cleaned and structured the data into three tables: orders, customers, and products.

Imported the data into pgAdmin (PostgreSQL) for querying.

Wrote 20+ business-driven SQL queries ranging from simple summaries to complex window functions.

Covered real-world business questions like:

Who are the top customers?

Which products or regions bring in the most revenue?

How are sales trending month by month?

What’s the average shipping delay?

Also included questions ideal for dashboards and data visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau.

🧱 Tech Stack:

💡 Why This Project Matters:
It shows how data analysts can extract powerful insights from simple order data using only SQL. Whether it's optimizing profit, identifying top products, or understanding customer behavior — SQL helps answer real business questions.
